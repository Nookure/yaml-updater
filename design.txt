Multiline strings:

include_newlines: |
            exactly as you see
            will appear these three
            lines of poetry

fold_newlines: >
            this is really a
            single line of text
            despite appearances
(may end with +- also (keep/not whitespace after): |+, >-)

support environment files to substitute placeholders!


installation require:
  - file to add properties from (or copy it as is on first install)
  - file with remove properties
  - environment files (to replace variables)


keep in mind commented blocks/properties of optional properties







all top comments are copied as is (on each level!)
    # something

    # something else

existing property(object)-related comments not changed
    # prop comment
    # multiline
    prop:

new comments are added only with the new properties
    # newcomment (cold contain missed lines!)_
    newprop:

between properties comments with empty lines are considered as single comment
    #line1

    #line2
    propWithEmptyLines:



1. comments copied separately
2. variables processed without structure knowledge (but detect \n in value and put | ??)
3. added values detected manually

look https://github.com/OndraZizka/yaml-merge
check https://github.com/ClearPointNZ/connect-java/tree/master/maven-plugins/merge-yaml-plugin as slightly improved version


NO delete file, instead use properties: a.b.c
deletes are applied to original file! so it would be possible to update property value by deleting property
(new value would be copied)
commented properties are also counted!

start with comments parser!

ability to specify reference yaml structure with all known properties to detect commented
